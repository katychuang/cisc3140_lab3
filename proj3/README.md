Author: Adina Scheinfeld (Github: @AdinaScheinfeld)

## Description

This project parses an input file and executes various awk scripts to provide a list of the top three cars overall, a list of the top three cars for each make, and a list of the top numRanks cars for the total racer scores, the total engine scores, the total body frame scores, the total mods scores, the mods overall scores, and the car overall scores.

Run `make p3` from root directory.


## Project structure

- [prog.awk](prog.awk) and [prog2.awk](prog2.awk) produce [ranks](ranks) which contains information on each car and its rank based on its total score, [sorted_ranks](sorted_ranks) which contains information on each car and its rank based on its total score, and [top_3](top_3) which contains information on the top 3 cars for each car make.

- [1-Racer](1-Racer) contains [script1.awk](1-Racer/script1.awk), [script2.awk](1-Racer/script2.awk), and [script3.awk](1-Racer/script3.awk). 
	- [script1.awk](1-Racer/script1.awk) parses the input file and prints data on each car with that car's total racer score to [output1.csv](1-Racer/output1.csv) in descending order of total racer score. The user can use the `y` variable in the [Makefile](../Makefile) to specify cars only from a specific year, or the user can set `y` to _all_ to get cars from all the years. The default value for `y` is _all_.
	- [script2.awk](1-Racer/script2.awk) parses [output1.csv](1-Racer/output1.csv) and prints data on each car with that car's total racer score and ranking to [output2.csv](1-Racer/output2.csv) in ascending order of ranking.
	- [script3.awk](1-Racer/script3.awk) parses [output2.csv](1-Racer/output2.csv) and prints data on the top `numRanks` cars with their total racer scores and rankings to [output3.csv](1-Racer/output3.csv), where `numRanks` is a variable that the user can set in the [Makefile](../Makefile). The default value for `numRanks` is _3_. 
 
- [2-Engine](2-Engine) contains [script4.awk](2-Engine/script4.awk), [script5.awk](2-Engine/script5.awk), and [script6.awk](2-Engine/script6.awk). 
	- [script4.awk](2-Engine/script4.awk) parses the input file and prints data on each car with that car's total engine score to [output4.csv](2-Engine/output4.csv) in descending order of total engine score. The user can use the `y` variable in the [Makefile](../Makefile) to specify cars only from a specific year, or the user can set `y` to _all_ to get cars from all the years. The default value for `y` is _all_.
	- [script5.awk](2-Engine/script5.awk) parses [output4.csv](2-Engine/output4.csv) and prints data on each car with that car's total engine score and ranking to [output5.csv](2-Engine/output5.csv) in ascending order of ranking.
	- [script6.awk](2-Engine/script6.awk) parses [output5.csv](2-Engine/output5.csv) and prints data on the top `numRanks` cars,their total engine scores, and rankings to [output6.csv](2-Engine/output6.csv), where `numRanks` is a variable that the user can set in the [Makefile](../Makefile). The default value for `numRanks` is _3_. 

- [3-Body_Frame](3-Body_Frame) contains [script7.awk](3-Body_Frame/script7.awk), [script8.awk](3-Body_Frame/script8.awk), and [script9.awk](3-Body_Frame/script9.awk). 
	- [script7.awk](3-Body_Frame/script7.awk) parses the input file and prints data on each car with that car's total body frame score to [output7.csv](3-Body_Frame/output7.csv) in descending order of total body frame score. The user can use the `y` variable in the [Makefile](../Makefile) to specify cars only from a specific year, or the user can set `y` to _all_ to get cars from all the years. The default value for `y` is _all_.
	- [script8.awk](3-Body_Frame/script8.awk) parses [output7.csv](3-Body_Frame/output7.csv) and prints data on each car with that car's total body frame score and ranking to [output8.csv](3-Body_Frame/output8.csv) in ascending order of ranking.
	- [script9.awk](3-Body_Frame/script9.awk) parses [output8.csv](3-Body_Frame/output8.csv) and prints data on the top `numRanks` cars, their total body frame scores, and rankings to [output9.csv](3-Body_Frame/output9.csv), where `numRanks` is a variable that the user can set in the [Makefile](../Makefile). The default value for `numRanks` is _3_. 

- [4-Mods](4-Mods) contains [script10.awk](4-Mods/script10.awk), [script11.awk](4-Mods/script11.awk), and [script12.awk](4-Mods/script12.awk). 
	- [script10.awk](4-Mods/script10.awk) parses the input file and prints data on each car with that car's total mods score to [output10.csv](4-Mods/output10.csv) in descending order of total mods score. The user can use the `y` variable in the [Makefile](../Makefile) to specify cars only from a specific year, or the user can set `y` to _all_ to get cars from all the years.
