### Overview
This is an analysis and modification of the Makefile along with each projects in the repository as part of Lab 3. Each project has a new feature or edit in which it provides more data being parsed as well as additional documentation. 
Each projects interact with the provided data.csv file and pulls various information sorted using AWK.

### Project 1 

Within Project 1, the original AWK program parses through the data.csv file and sums up all of the cars' scores and displays them.

In the new feature for Project 1, new classes are now provided such as Racer, Engine, Body*Frame, Mods, Mods_Overall, Car_Overall.
The new AWK programs now allow these classes to show in addition to ranking the top 3 cars. 

### Project 2

For Project 2, the original AWK program allows it to show select columns such as Total, car*ID, year, make, model, and ranking which then gets showed onto a report.csv.
The new feature added will be allowing the customization of the report in which information being output into the report.csv file can be changed for clarification.

### Project 3

Lastly, for Project 3, relevant fields are extracted such as Car*ID, Year, Make, Model, and Ranks which are then summed up to get a score to rank each car. The data is then sorted in descending order in a separate field/column and retrieving the top 3.
The new feature for Project 3 includes the modification of the Makefile in root folder such as adding instructions while also adding additional information within the documentation for each specific folder and subfolder. 

#### Additional Information

Each projects were reviewed and sorted prior to adding in the modifications and new features. 
Projects were each divided equally and done over Linux.
