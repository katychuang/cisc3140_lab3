## Problem Description

Evaluate the provided projects' documentation and source code, modify each project with the proposed changes, and prepare a group presentation on the expereince.

## Project Outline

The [proj1](proj1) folder contains all scripts and output files for project 1. Inside the folder, there is a [README](proj1/README.md) file with a description of the project and its dependencies, the project structure, instructions for how to execute the program, and a summary of the results from running the program.

The [proj2](proj2) folder contains all scripts and output files for project 2. Inside the folder, there is a [README](proj2/README.md) file with a description of the project, instructions on how to execute the program, a list of the known bugs and their temporary fixes, an outline of the project structure, and a list of the project's dependencies. 

The [proj3](proj3) folder contains all scripts and output files for project 3. Inside the folder, there is a [README](proj3/README.md) file with a description of the project including a tree diagram of the file and directory structure, instructions for how to execute the program, an outline of the project structure, and a list of the project's dependencies. 

## Dependencies

The dependencies for each individual project can be found in the README in each project's subfolder. However, all the projects require GNU Awk and GNU Make. 

## How to use?

All projects run from the root of the project repository using the default make target _all_. Instructions for executing each individual project can be found in the README in each project's subfolder.
